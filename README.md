# 🔥 **Fever Diagnosis Analysis & Prediction** 🔥

## 📚 **Overview**

Welcome to the **Fever Diagnosis Analysis & Prediction** project! This is a **Machine Learning (ML) model** designed to predict whether a patient has a fever based on various features, using a **trending Kaggle dataset**. This dataset contains a diverse set of patient-related information that allows us to apply **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict fever and enhance diagnostic accuracy.

### 🚀 **Objective**
The main objective of this project is to **predict fever diagnoses** using ML models based on various patient parameters. This is an exciting dataset on Kaggle, and we're diving deep into understanding the patterns that help us predict fever more accurately!

## 🧠 **Approach**

### 1️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍**

EDA is the first step to understanding the dataset and gaining insights into its structure. Here's what we do during this phase:
- **Data Cleaning** 🧹: Handle missing values, outliers, and duplicate records.
- **Data Visualization** 📊: Generate graphs like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to uncover hidden patterns.
- **Feature Distribution Analysis** 📈: Visualize how different features vary and correlate with the target variable (fever diagnosis).
  
### 2️⃣ **Feature Engineering 🛠️**

Feature engineering helps to create new features that can improve the model's performance:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Impute or remove rows/columns with missing values.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Use techniques like One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
- **Scaling Features**: Normalize continuous variables for better model performance.
- **Feature Selection** 🧳: Identify which features have the most predictive power.

### 3️⃣ **Machine Learning Models ⚡**
We build several machine learning models to predict the fever diagnosis:
- **Logistic Regression** 🤓
- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 🧑‍💻
- **XGBoost** 💥
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** 👯
- **Neural Networks** (Optional) 🧠

The models are compared using different metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.
